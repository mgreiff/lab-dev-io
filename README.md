# The Beagle Project
The beagle project aims to create pythonic tools for open source 
development of control systems with light licensing.

The tools come with examples and real time implementations using a
Beagle-Bone Black (rev C), Simulink models and equivalent implementations 
in Python.

The work has rrecently been revived and any contribution is appreciated!
